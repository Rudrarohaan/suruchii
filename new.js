'Word cannot fully capture the depth of your beauty. You are without a doubt, one of the most beautiful soul I have ever encountered. You are a rare gem in the world. Each time I see you, my heart swells and the light you bring into the world administration for the person you are. I want you to know the profound impact you have had on my life. You possess a rare ability to make everyone around you feel valued and cherished, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have you by my side. Today, as I offer you this humble gift of a jhmuka, I am acutely aware of its insignificance in comparison to the magnitude of your impact on my life. I donnot know how you will like this jhumka, as I have no idea about this stuff, but I chose it with all my heart for you. It is as if the jhumka itself pales in comparison to the radiant beauty it enhances when worn by you. In the delicate curves of this jhumka, I envision echoes of your grace, resilence and inner strength. This small token of affection is a reflection of my admiration for you and a reminder of the countless reason why you mean so much to me.';
